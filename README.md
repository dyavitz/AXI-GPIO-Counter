AXI GPIO Counter on Zynq

This project is designed to help me learn how to communicate between the Processing System (PS) and Programmable Logic (PL) on a Zynq SoC using AXI GPIO. It implements a simple button-controlled counter in the FPGA fabric, which sends its value back to the PS. The PS reads this value via AXI GPIO and maps it to the systemâ€™s LEDs.
